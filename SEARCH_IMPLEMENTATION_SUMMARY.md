## 💡 Implementation Details

### How It Works

1. **On Page Load:**

   - SearchBar component fetches all product names once
   - Stores them in local state

2. **While Typing:**

   - Filters pre-loaded products client-side
   - Shows top 8 matching results
   - Highlights matching text

3. **On Suggestion Click:**

   - Navigates to product detail page (`/products/:id`)

4. **On Enter/Search Button:**
   - Navigates to products page with search query (`/products?search=term`)
   - Products page fetches search results from API

### Performance Optimization

- Pre-loading eliminates lag during typing
- Client-side filtering is instant
- Only full searches hit the API
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

## 🔄 Integration

The search feature integrates seamlessly with:

- ✅ Existing product catalog
- ✅ Category filtering
- ✅ Inventory system
- ✅ Dark mode theme
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Navigation system

## 🎯 User Flow

```
User types "iphone" in search bar
  ↓
Autocomplete shows matching products instantly
  ↓
User can either:
  → Click suggestion → Go to product detail page
  → Press Enter → Go to search results page
  → Keep typing → See updated suggestions
  → Press Esc → Close suggestions
```

## 🔧 Configuration

No additional configuration required. The feature uses existing:

- Database schema
- API structure

## 📝 Notes

- Product names are cached in component state for fast filtering
- Backend search supports partial matching with SQL LIKE

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
